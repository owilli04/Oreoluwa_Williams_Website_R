Study Buddy is a dedicated platform created only for Towson University students to better tailor to their needs. This creates a one stop app for study groups and allows communicating with classmates.
By providing a centralized platform tailored to unique needs, this application aims to streamline the process of finding study groups or partners, thereby enhancing the collaborative learning experience. I was able to acquire knowledge of creating the front end using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and Firebase, which creates the backend database.
