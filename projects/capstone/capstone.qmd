Worked in a group of 4 to analyze Premature deaths focusing on the research topic "Do income inequality, unemployment and high school completion rates affect the number of premature deaths of certain racial groups at the county level?" working with County Health Rankings Data 2024. So we built EDA's and Modelling technique models to predict premature deaths.
